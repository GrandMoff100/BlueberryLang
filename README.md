# Blueberry

Welcome to a berry cool language!
Blueberry is a static typed language written in RPython and compiled with PyPy.

# Running a script
Right now as this project is in extreme pre-alpha
you can use the command
```bash
$ pypy3 -m blueberry <path_to_berry_file>
```

Where you replace `<path_to_berry_file>` with the path to the .berry file you want to run.
